### Platform agnosticism

Nest is a platform-agnostic framework.
This means you can develop **reusable logical parts** that can be used across different types of applications.
For example, most components can be re-used without change across different underlying HTTP server frameworks (e.g., Express and Fastify), and even across different _types_ of applications (e.g., HTTP server frameworks, Microservices with different transport layers, and Web Sockets).

#### Build once, use everywhere

The **Overview** section of the documentation primarily shows coding techniques using HTTP server frameworks (e.g., apps providing a REST API or providing an MVC-style server-side rendered app).
However, all those building blocks can be used on top of different transport layers ([microservices](/microservices/basics) or [websockets](/websockets/gateways)).

Furthermore, Nest comes with a dedicated [GraphQL](/graphql/quick-start) module.
You can use GraphQL as your API layer interchangeably with providing a REST API.

In addition, the [application context](/application-context) feature helps to create any kind of Node.js application - including things like CRON jobs and CLI apps - on top of Nest.

Nest aspires to be a full-fledged platform for Node.js apps that brings a higher-level of modularity and reusability to your applications.
Build once, use everywhere!
